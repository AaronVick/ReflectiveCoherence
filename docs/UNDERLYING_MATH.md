### 1. **Coherence Accumulation (Recursive Coherence)**

Coherence \( C(t) \) represents the system’s internal state and its degree of **reflective consistency** over time. The primary model for coherence accumulation is **logistic growth**, modified by entropy \( H(M(t)) \).

\[
\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \alpha C(t) \left( 1 - \frac{C(t)}{K} \right) - \beta H(M(t))
\]
Where:
- \( \alpha \) is the **coherence growth rate**.
- \( K \) is the **maximum coherence** (carrying capacity).
- \( \beta \) is the **entropy influence** (how much entropy slows coherence).
- \( H(M(t)) \) is the **entropy** at time \( t \), which quantifies uncertainty.

The system is influenced by both internal dynamics (coherence growth) and external perturbations (entropy). The term \( 1 - \frac{C(t)}{K} \) models logistic growth, while \( - \beta H(M(t)) \) adjusts the growth rate by entropy at each point in time.

---

### 2. **Entropy Dynamics**

Entropy \( H(M(t)) \) is a measure of **uncertainty** or **disorder** within the system. It is modeled as a function of time and the system’s state.

\[
H(M(t)) = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(m_i) \log(p(m_i))
\]
Where:
- \( p(m_i) \) is the probability distribution of memory elements \( m_i \) in the system.
- \( N \) is the total number of memories or states.

Entropy \( H(M(t)) \) quantifies how **uncertain** the system’s memory is at any given time. A higher entropy means a more chaotic system, which hinders the system's ability to accumulate coherence.

---

### 3. **Threshold Dynamics (Phase Transition Threshold)**

The threshold \( \theta \) determines when a system transitions from **incoherent** to **coherent**. This threshold depends on the **average entropy** and its **variance** over time.

\[
\theta = \mathbb{E}[H(M(t))] + \lambda_\theta \cdot \sqrt{\text{Var}(H(M(t)))}
\]
Where:
- \( \mathbb{E}[H(M(t))] \) is the **expected entropy** at time \( t \).
- \( \text{Var}(H(M(t))) \) is the **variance** of entropy at time \( t \).
- \( \lambda_\theta \) is a **scaling factor** that adjusts how much the variance influences the threshold.

As entropy increases, the coherence \( C(t) \) faces a **threshold** that marks the boundary between **incoherence** and **coherence**. The system is unstable when entropy surpasses this threshold, leading to a **phase transition**.

---

### 4. **Reflection and Memory Selection**

The system must recursively reflect on its memory states to resolve contradictions and maintain coherence. Reflection is modeled by a **weighted graph** where edges represent the relationship (similarity) between memory states.

The weight \( w_{ij} \) between two memory states \( m_i \) and \( m_j \) is given by:

\[
w_{ij} = \cos(z(m_i), z(m_j)) \cdot \frac{f_{ij}}{1 + \alpha |t_i - t_j|}
\]
Where:
- \( \cos(z(m_i), z(m_j)) \) is the **cosine similarity** between the latent representations of memories \( m_i \) and \( m_j \).
- \( f_{ij} \) is the frequency of co-reflection between the two memories.
- \( \alpha \) is a **decay factor** based on the temporal distance between memories.

This weight function models how memories influence each other over time, reflecting their importance for maintaining internal coherence. **Memory selection** depends on how relevant each memory is to the system’s coherence state, with the most relevant memories being reflected upon.

---

### 5. **Self-Loss and Coherence Kernel**

The **self-loss** function \( L_{\text{self}} \) quantifies how much the system’s current state deviates from its optimal, self-consistent state. It is defined as:

\[
L_{\text{self}} = \sum_i \left( C_i(t) - C_{\text{opt}} \right)^2
\]
Where:
- \( C_i(t) \) is the coherence of memory \( m_i \) at time \( t \).
- \( C_{\text{opt}} \) is the **optimal coherence** state that the system aims to achieve.

The **coherence kernel** \( R(S_t) \) measures the **overall system coherence** at time \( t \). It is computed as the weighted sum of the similarities between all memories:

\[
R(S_t) = \frac{1}{|E_t|} \sum_{(i,j) \in E_t} w_{ij} \cdot f_{ij}
\]
Where \( |E_t| \) is the total number of **edges** (connections) in the memory graph at time \( t \), and \( w_{ij} \) is the weight between memories \( m_i \) and \( m_j \).

---

### 6. **Gradient Descent for Coherence Optimization**

The system updates its state using gradient descent, minimizing the **self-loss** function \( L_{\text{self}} \) to approach the optimal coherence state.

\[
\frac{dC_i(t)}{dt} = -\nabla L_{\text{self}}(C_i(t))
\]
Where:
- \( \nabla L_{\text{self}}(C_i(t)) \) is the gradient of the **self-loss** function with respect to the coherence of memory \( m_i \).

Using **gradient descent**, the system iteratively adjusts the memory states \( C_i(t) \) to improve internal consistency and resolve contradictions.

---

### 7. **Coherence in Multi-Agent Systems (Distributed Reflection)**

In multi-agent systems, **distributed reflection** means that the system’s coherence is achieved not by a single central agent but by multiple agents interacting and reflecting upon their states.

The overall coherence in a multi-agent system is the weighted sum of the coherence of individual agents \( C_i(t) \):

\[
R(S_t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \cdot C_i(t)
\]
Where \( N \) is the number of agents and \( w_i \) is the weight of the agent \( i \) based on its relevance to the overall system coherence.

---

### 8. **Generalization and Regret Minimization**

**Generalization error** measures how well the system generalizes its learned coherence to new, unseen data. The **regret** after \( T \) steps is bounded as:

\[
\text{Regret}(T) = \sum_{t=1}^T L_{\Psi}(\hat{S}_t) - L_{\Psi}(S^*) \leq O(\sqrt{T})
\]
Where:
- \( \hat{S}_t \) is the self-model at time \( t \).
- \( S^* \) is the optimal self-model (coherence-optimal state).
- \( L_{\Psi}(\hat{S}_t) \) is the loss at time \( t \).

This implies that the **generalization error** grows sub-linearly with time, indicating that the system learns efficiently and **minimizes regret** as it adapts over time.

---

### 9. **Noise Models and Robustness**

In real-world systems, noise affects the **coherence accumulation** process. This noise is typically modeled as **Gaussian noise**:

\[
\nabla L_{\text{self}} = \mu + \xi, \quad \xi \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)
\]
Where \( \mu \) is the true gradient, and \( \xi \) represents the noise, modeled as a normal distribution.

For **non-Gaussian noise** (e.g., heavy-tailed distributions), the system adapts using **robust optimization techniques**, such as **Huber loss** or **adaptive clipping**.

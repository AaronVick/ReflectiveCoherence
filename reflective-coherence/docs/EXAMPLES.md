## Example 1: Basic Coherence Growth

This example demonstrates the fundamental behavior of coherence growth under stable conditions with minimal entropy.

### Parameters
- **Name**: Basic_Growth
- **α (alpha)**: 0.1
- **β (beta)**: 0.1
- **K**: 1.0
- **Initial Coherence**: 0.2
- **Entropy Function**: Constant
- **Entropy Value**: 0.2
- **Simulation Time**: 100
- **Time Steps**: 500

### Expected Results
The coherence will follow a classic S-shaped (sigmoidal) growth curve, starting slowly, then accelerating, and finally approaching the maximum coherence asymptotically.

### Interpretation
This experiment shows the basic logistic growth pattern that coherence follows when entropy is low and constant. The system should reach a coherent state where final coherence is greater than the threshold.

### Key Insights
- The initial slow growth represents the "bootstrap" phase where coherence is being established
- The steepest part of the curve shows maximum growth rate
- The flattening at the top represents diminishing returns as coherence approaches maximum capacity

## Example 2: Entropy Influence Comparison

This example explores how different levels of entropy influence affect coherence accumulation.

### Setup Multiple Experiments
Run three separate experiments with these parameters:

#### Experiment 2.1: Low Entropy Influence
- **Name**: Low_Beta
- **α (alpha)**: 0.1
- **β (beta)**: 0.1 (Low entropy influence)
- **K**: 1.0
- **Initial Coherence**: 0.5
- **Entropy Function**: Constant
- **Entropy Value**: 0.3

#### Experiment 2.2: Medium Entropy Influence
- **Name**: Medium_Beta
- **α (alpha)**: 0.1
- **β (beta)**: 0.3 (Medium entropy influence)
- **K**: 1.0
- **Initial Coherence**: 0.5
- **Entropy Function**: Constant
- **Entropy Value**: 0.3

#### Experiment 2.3: High Entropy Influence
- **Name**: High_Beta
- **α (alpha)**: 0.1
- **β (beta)**: 0.5 (High entropy influence)
- **K**: 1.0
- **Initial Coherence**: 0.5
- **Entropy Function**: Constant
- **Entropy Value**: 0.3

### Comparison
After running all three experiments, use the "Compare Experiments" feature to visualize the differences in coherence trajectories.

### Expected Results
- **Low_Beta**: High final coherence (approximately 0.8-0.9)
- **Medium_Beta**: Moderate final coherence (approximately 0.5-0.7)
- **High_Beta**: Low final coherence (approximately 0.3-0.5)

### Interpretation
This comparison demonstrates how the β parameter controls the system's sensitivity to entropy. Higher β values make the system more susceptible to entropy's disruptive effects, resulting in lower coherence accumulation.

## Example 3: Phase Transition Observation

This example demonstrates how a system can transition between coherent and incoherent states when entropy crosses critical thresholds.

### Parameters
- **Name**: Phase_Transition
- **α (alpha)**: 0.15
- **β (beta)**: 0.4
- **K**: 1.0
- **Initial Coherence**: 0.6
- **Entropy Function**: Oscillating
- **Base Entropy**: 0.3
- **Amplitude**: 0.2
- **Frequency**: 0.05
- **Simulation Time**: 200
- **Time Steps**: 1000

### Expected Results
The system will alternate between coherent and incoherent states as entropy oscillates. When entropy peaks, coherence will drop below the threshold, and when entropy is at its minimum, coherence will rise above the threshold.

### Interpretation
This experiment visualizes the critical transitions between coherent and incoherent states. The threshold (green dashed line) serves as the boundary between these two phases, and the system crosses this boundary multiple times during the simulation.

### Key Points to Observe
- Notice how coherence decreases more rapidly when it's high and entropy increases
- Look for "critical slowing down" near the threshold (coherence changes more slowly close to the threshold)
- Observe how the system becomes more stable in either the coherent or incoherent state the further it gets from the threshold

## Example 4: Oscillating Entropy Response

This example explores how systems with different growth rates respond to cyclical patterns of entropy.

### Setup Multiple Experiments
Run two separate experiments with these parameters:

#### Experiment 4.1: Low Growth Rate
- **Name**: Slow_Response
- **α (alpha)**: 0.05 (Slow growth)
- **β (beta)**: 0.2
- **K**: 1.0
- **Initial Coherence**: 0.5
- **Entropy Function**: Oscillating
- **Base Entropy**: 0.3
- **Amplitude**: 0.15
- **Frequency**: 0.1

#### Experiment 4.2: High Growth Rate
- **Name**: Fast_Response
- **α (alpha)**: 0.2 (Fast growth)
- **β (beta)**: 0.2
- **K**: 1.0
- **Initial Coherence**: 0.5
- **Entropy Function**: Oscillating
- **Base Entropy**: 0.3
- **Amplitude**: 0.15
- **Frequency**: 0.1

### Comparison
After running both experiments, compare them to see the differences in how they respond to the same entropy fluctuations.

### Expected Results
- **Slow_Response**: Coherence will lag behind entropy changes and show smaller oscillations
- **Fast_Response**: Coherence will respond more quickly to entropy changes and show larger oscillations

### Interpretation
This comparison reveals how the growth rate (α) affects a system's responsiveness to environmental changes. Systems with higher growth rates adapt more quickly but may also be more volatile. Systems with lower growth rates are more stable but slower to recover from entropic disruptions.

## Example 5: System Resilience Testing

This example tests how well a system can recover from major entropic disruptions.

### Parameters
- **Name**: Resilience_Test
- **α (alpha)**: 0.12
- **β (beta)**: 0.25
- **K**: 1.0
- **Initial Coherence**: 0.7
- **Entropy Function**: Increasing
- **Starting Entropy**: 0.1
- **Increase Rate**: 0.003
- **Simulation Time**: 300
- **Time Steps**: 1000

### Expected Results
The system will initially maintain high coherence, but as entropy steadily increases, coherence will eventually begin to decline. At some point, the system will cross the threshold from coherent to incoherent.

### Interpretation
This experiment tests the system's resilience by gradually increasing entropy until failure occurs. The point at which coherence begins to decline significantly indicates the system's resilience limit. The time it takes to cross the threshold indicates how long the system can withstand increasing entropic pressure.

### Key Analysis Points
- Identify the "tipping point" where coherence begins to decline rapidly
- Calculate the entropy level at this tipping point
- Determine the time it takes for the system to transition from coherent to incoherent
- Observe any early warning signals before the major decline

## Creating Your Own Experiments

When designing your own experiments, consider exploring these relationships:

1. **Parameter Sensitivity**: How do small changes in parameters affect outcomes?
   - Try incremental changes to α, β, or initial coherence

2. **Environmental Conditions**: How do different entropy patterns represent real-world scenarios?
   - Constant entropy: Stable environment
   - Increasing entropy: Growing complexity or deteriorating order
   - Decreasing entropy: Learning or adaptation
   - Oscillating entropy: Cyclical external pressures

3. **Recovery Testing**: How well can systems recover from entropy spikes?
   - Design entropy functions with sudden peaks
   - Observe how quickly coherence recovers

4. **Threshold Dynamics**: What determines whether a system stays coherent?
   - Experiment with parameters that bring the system close to its threshold
   - Observe factors that push the system over the edge

Remember that these experiments serve as abstract models of complex systems. The insights gained can be applied to understand resilience, adaptation, and stability across many domains - from cognitive systems to organizational structures and biological networks.

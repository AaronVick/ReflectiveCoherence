# Accessibility Roadmap for Reflective Coherence Explorer

This document outlines our strategy for enhancing accessibility of the Reflective Coherence Explorer while maintaining rigorous scientific standards and mathematical accuracy. The goal is to create dual interfaces that serve both expert researchers and students/non-experts without compromising the underlying mathematical foundations.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Zero Scientific Compromise**: All simplifications are presentational only; the underlying calculations, models, and results must remain 100% mathematically accurate
2. **Direct Core Linkage**: Every simplified element must link directly to its corresponding scientific concept
3. **Parameter Traceability**: All parameter presets and simplified controls must map explicitly to exact values used in the mathematical model
4. **Verification Process**: Each accessibility enhancement must be validated against the PhD-level specifications
5. **Documentation Consistency**: All simplified explanations must be consistent with the rigorous definitions in UNDERLYING_MATH.md

## Dual Interface Implementation

### 1. Mode Selection Architecture

| Component | Scientific Design Preservation | Implementation Approach |
|-----------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Mode Selection Toggle | User preference only; no impact on calculation engine | Add UI switch that alters only display components |
| Parameter Mapping | All simplified parameters map 1:1 to scientific parameters | Create explicit mapping table with verification checks |
| Results Display | Same data, different visualization options | Visualization layer separated from calculation layer |

### 2. Expert Mode (Current System)

Maintains all current functionality without modification:
- Full parameter control (α, β, K, etc.)
- Complete mathematical notation
- Detailed entropy function selection
- Comprehensive metrics and analysis

### 3. Basic Mode Development

| Feature | Scientific Integrity Approach | Verification Method |
|---------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Simplified Parameter Controls | Backend uses exact same mathematical parameters | Automated tests comparing results between modes |
| Preset Experiment Templates | Defined by expert users with precise parameter values | Each template validated against mathematical models |
| Visual Results Interpretation | Raw data identical; interpretive layer added | Side-by-side comparison with expert mode results |
| Guided Experiment Builder | Questions map to exact mathematical parameter adjustments | Decision tree validated by PhD-level review |

## Documentation Enhancement

### 1. EXPLORER_BASICS.md Development ✓

Will include:
- Real-world analogies directly mapped to mathematical concepts
- Visual guides with direct links to mathematical formulations
- Step-by-step tutorials using validated templates
- Glossary with both simplified and rigorous definitions

**Status**: Complete - Created comprehensive guide with clear explanations, real-world analogies, and direct mapping to scientific concepts while maintaining mathematical accuracy.

### 2. PARAMETER_MAPPING.md Development ✓

Includes:
- Explicit mapping between simplified UI terms and mathematical parameters
- Clear range definitions for all parameter translations
- Detailed experiment template specifications with scientific justification
- Verification approach for parameter integrity

**Status**: Complete - Created detailed parameter mapping document that ensures every simplified term has a precise mathematical equivalent.

### 3. Enhanced Visualizations

| Visualization | Scientific Accuracy Maintenance | Implementation Approach |
|---------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Interpretive Overlays | Highlight exact mathematical transitions | Based on precise threshold calculations |
| Key Event Markers | Triggered by specific mathematical conditions | Use same detection algorithms as expert analysis |
| Real-world Comparisons | Mathematical model applied to familiar contexts | Same equations with contextual framing |

## Implementation and Testing

### 1. Implementation Planning ✓

The technical implementation plan has been developed in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, which outlines:
- Architectural approach that preserves mathematical integrity
- Component specifications with sample code
- Integration strategy to ensure scientific consistency
- Testing methodology to verify parameter translation accuracy

**Status**: Complete - Created detailed implementation plan that ensures complete separation between UI simplification and mathematical calculations.

### 2. Implementation Tracking

A comprehensive implementation and testing checklist has been created in IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md to track:
- Implementation status of all components
- Testing requirements and coverage
- Verification status for each feature
- Sign-off requirements for deployment

This ensures that we systematically address all aspects of the implementation while maintaining rigorous scientific standards.

### 3. Testing Framework Initialization ✓

Initial testing framework has been established:
- Created test_parameter_translation.py with comprehensive test cases
- Implemented mock translator for testing parameter integrity
- Designed tests for bidirectional translation accuracy
- Included validation for experiment templates

**Status**: Initial framework complete - Ready for expansion during implementation

## Verification Process

For each component:
1. Development based on UNDERLYING_MATH.md specifications
2. Implementation with traceability to mathematical formulations
3. Automated testing comparing results between modes
4. Expert review to confirm no deviation from PhD-level design
5. Documentation of parameter mappings and simplification approach

## Traceability Matrix

A complete matrix will be maintained to ensure every simplified element maps directly to its corresponding scientific concept:

| Simplified Element | Mathematical Component | UNDERLYING_MATH.md Reference | Verification Status |
|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| "System Growth Speed" | α (alpha) - Coherence growth rate | Section 1, Equation 1 | Tests Created |

| "System Capacity" | K - Maximum coherence | Section 1, Equation 1 | Tests Created |
| "Starting Stability" | Initial coherence value | Section 1 | Tests Created |
| "Environmental Pattern" | Entropy function selection | Section 2 | Test Framework Ready |

## Review Checkpoints

Regular review sessions will be conducted to ensure scientific integrity:
1. Architecture review before implementation begins
2. Parameter mapping review before UI development
3. Calculation verification during implementation
4. Full system validation before release

This document will be continuously updated throughout development to track all decisions and verify that the enhanced accessibility features never compromise the scientific and mathematical foundations of the system.
